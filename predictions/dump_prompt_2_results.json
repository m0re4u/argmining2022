Despite all the exaggerated Republican rhetoric that the bill will lead to fiscal disaster, it has been carefully and responsibly drafted so that it is fully paid for without busting future budgets.\nCONCLUSION: 2009 health care reform would cut deficits\nVALIDITY:valid\n\nTOPIC: US and NATO intervention in Libya\nPREMISE: James Joyner: \"While one can debate the degree to which the presidency is imperial, it\u2019s simply untrue that the war in Libya is illegal in any shape, manner, or form.

Close contact between humans and animals also leads to zoonosis \u2013 diseases such as bird \u2018flu which can be passed on from animals to humans. Hunters eating apes and monkeys is thought to have brought HIV/AIDS to humans. And using animal brains in the processed feed for livestock led to BSE in cattle and to CJD in humans who ate beef from infected cows.\nCONCLUSION: Vegetarians are vulnerable to disease and pests\nVALIDITY:",

Will it produce more troops from our NATO allies to finish the job in Afghanistan? Not likely. When the world sees how good and fair we are, will it love America more and will terrorists decide to kill us less? Only in the world of make-believe inhabited by American Civil Liberties Union lawyers.\nCONCLUSION: Terrorists will not be tried in civilian courts.\nNOVELTY:not-novel\n\nTOPIC: Trying terrorist suspects in civilian courts\nPREMISE: there is no longer much difference between a military and civilian trial. After the U.S. Supreme Court weighed in on the shortcomings of George W. Bush\u2019s tribunals, Congress and the Obama administration granted more rights to the accused.\" Therefore, trying terrorists in civilian courts is little different, and not more risky.\nCONCLUSION: Terrorists can be tried in civilian courts, unlike military courts\nNOVELTY:not-novel\n\nTOPIC: Trying terrorist suspects in civilian courts\nPREMISE: In deciding to use federal court, the attorney general probably considered the record of the military commission system that was established in November 2001. This system secured three convictions in eight years. The only person who had a full commission trial, Osama bin Laden's driver, received five additional months in prison, resulting in a sentence that was shorter than he probably would have received from a federal judge.\nCONCLUSION: Military commissions have a strong record\nNOVELTY:novel\n\nTOPIC: Vegetarianism\nPREMISE: The notion of man's dominion over animals need not be thought of as a blank check for man to exploit animals. Indeed, it may be appropriate to connect the notion of \"dominion\" to stewardship\" over animals. Yet, humans can be good stewards of animals while continuing to eat them. It is merely necessary that humans maintain balance, order, and sustainability in the animal kingdom. But, again, this does not require the abandonment of meat-eating.\nCONCLUSION: Dominion over animals can and should be used responsibly\nNOVELTY:",

Most drug crimes aren\u2019t committed by people trying to pay for drugs; they\u2019re committed by people on drugs.\u2014 US Drug Enforcement Administration (2003). \"Speaking Out Against Drug Legalization\" DUF research indicates that: Frequent use of hard drugs is one of the strongest indicators of a criminal career. Offenders who use drugs are among the most serious and active criminals, engaging in both property and violent crime. Early and persistent use of cocaine or heroin in the juvenile years is an indicator of serious, persistent criminal behavior in adulthood. Those arrested who are drug users are more likely than those not using drugs to be rearrested on pretrial release or fail to appear at trial.\nCONCLUSION: Drug use and crime are not directly linked to criminal acts\nVALIDITY:",

Why is there such a rush to pass this bill now? It's because the President of the United States recognizes that it is hurting his numbers, and he wants it off the agenda. It might not be ready to be passed. In fact, it's obviously not ready! Yet that doesn't matter. The President wants this out of the way by his State of the Union Address. This is nakedly self-interested political calculation by the President - nothing more and nothing less.\nCONCLUSION: 2009 health bill rushed through for political reasons\nNOVELTY:not-novel\n\nTOPIC: Turkey EU membership\nPREMISE: This was when its candidacy was unanimously accepted after three decades of consistent Turkish requests.\nCONCLUSION: The electoral college helps protect the interests of smaller states in the union\nNOVELTY:not-novel\n\nTOPIC: War on Drugs\nPREMISE: It has been suggested that ending prohibition could reduce the use of hard drugs as it has in countries such as The Netherlands. Since alcohol prohibition ended and the War on Drugs began there has been much debate over the issue of consistency among legislators with regard to drug prohibition. Many anti-prohibition activists focus on the well-documented dangers of alcohol (such as alcoholism, cystisis, domestic violence, brain and liver damage). In addition to anecdotal evidence, they cite statistics to show more deaths caused by drunk driving under the influence of alcohol than by drivers under the influence of marijuana,[70] and research which suggests that alcohol is more harmful than all but the most \"\"dangerous\"\" drugs. When the level of harm associated with the other drugs includes harm that arises solely as a result of the drugs illegality rather than merely that danger which is associated with actually using the drugs, only heroin, cocaine, barbiturates and street methadone were shown to be more harmful than the legal drug alcohol).\nCONCLUSION: Drug prohibition does not reduce use of hard drugs.\nNOVELTY:",

They are already kidnapping, torturing, and killing foreign troops without any calculating consideration of whether the country they oppose is utilizing the tactic of torture. Terrorists are already as extreme as can be; they won't be made more extreme and threatening to sovereign troops because a country is committing torture.\nCONCLUSION: Terrorists are going to kidnap, torture, and kill Western troops regardless of whether the West\nNOVELTY:not-novel\n\nTOPIC: Twin Towers reconstruction\nPREMISE: Pentagon, hardly a symbol of peace, has been rebuilt. Twin towers weren't. The message that this sends to the public is hardly positive.\nCONCLUSION: Pentagon rebuild sends wrong message of peace\nNOVELTY:novel\n\nTOPIC: US health care reform\nPREMISE: ObamaCare would require Americans to buy government-approved health insurance. It would make it illegal to offer choices in insurance plans beyond the handful of very similar ones that the government would allow. It would become illegal to offer new and innovative plans.

Offshore drilling may be a short-term solution to a long-term energy problem, but if countries like China can already drill and drain our nearby coastal regions of oil and gas deposits, there's no reason why we shouldn't save ourselves a few bucks at the gas pump until alternative energy sources are further developed.\nCONCLUSION: Offshore drilling is a cost-effective solution to US energy crisis\nVALIDITY:not-valid\n\nTOPIC: Trying terrorist suspects in civilian courts\nPREMISE: our federal courts have waged an admirable war of their own against terrorists, whether the judges call it that or not. Our civilian courts have tried 195 cases of terrorism since 2001, according to Justice Department figures, and 91percent of them have resulted in convictions.\nCONCLUSION: US courts have been successful in terrorism cases\nVALIDITY:valid\n\nTOPIC: Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository\nPREMISE: If the U.S. Government cancels the license for the Yucca Mountain Nuclear Waste Repository, it will likely constitute a full \"breach of contract\", potentially costing around 1 billion dollars.
