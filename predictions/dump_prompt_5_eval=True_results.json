Many anti-prohibition activists focus on the well-documented dangers of alcohol (such as alcoholism, cystisis, domestic violence, brain and liver damage). In addition to anecdotal evidence, they cite statistics to show more deaths caused by drunk driving under the influence of alcohol than by drivers under the influence of marijuana,[70] and research which suggests that alcohol is more harmful than all but the most \"\"dangerous\"\" drugs. When the level of harm associated with the other drugs includes harm that arises solely as a result of the drugs illegality rather than merely that danger which is associated with actually using the drugs, only heroin, cocaine, barbiturates and street methadone were shown to be more harmful than the legal drug alcohol).\nCONCLUSION: Ending alcohol prohibition would reduce the use of hard drugs.\nVALIDITY:", "text": "not-valid", "tokens": ["not", "-", "valid", "<|endoftext|>", "\n", "\n", "The", " following"], "logprob": [-0.2302961, -0.0006344049, -0.00026743364, -0.003421878, -1.8862351, -0.68677866, -2.8582032, -3.3418355]}, "pred_nov": "not-novel", "pred_val": "not-valid"}, {"y_nov": null, "y_val": null, "x_nov": "TOPIC: Turkey EU membership\nPREMISE: This was when its candidacy was unanimously accepted after three decades of consistent Turkish requests.\nCONCLUSION: The EU approved the Turkish candidacy in 2004\nNOVELTY:not-novel\n\nTOPIC: US offshore oil drilling\nPREMISE: These large ships release significant pollution into the oceans, and carry some risk of hitting the shore, and causing a spill.\nCONCLUSION: Large oil drilling rigs are often anchored offshore\nNOVELTY:novel\n\nTOPIC: Twin Towers reconstruction\nPREMISE: The best memorial for the victims of 9/11 and the ensuing wars would definitely be rebuilt Twin Towers, not two uglish pits.\nCONCLUSION: Twin Towers would be a better memorial for 9/11\nNOVELTY:not-novel\n\nTOPIC: Unilateral US military strike inside Pakistan\nPREMISE: We can do that using the leverage of aid to induce democracy.\nCONCLUSION: Pressure on Pakistan is a good way to force democracy\nNOVELTY:novel\n\nTOPIC: War on Drugs\nPREMISE: The United States' \"War on Drugs\" has added considerably to the political instability in South America.

Since alcohol prohibition ended and the War on Drugs began there has been much debate over the issue of consistency among legislators with regard to drug prohibition. Many anti-prohibition activists focus on the well-documented dangers of alcohol (such as alcoholism, cystisis, domestic violence, brain and liver damage). In addition to anecdotal evidence, they cite statistics to show more deaths caused by drunk driving under the influence of alcohol than by drivers under the influence of marijuana,[70] and research which suggests that alcohol is more harmful than all but the most \"\"dangerous\"\" drugs.
