Close contact between humans and animals also leads to zoonosis \u2013 diseases such as bird \u2018flu which can be passed on from animals to humans. Hunters eating apes and monkeys is thought to have brought HIV/AIDS to humans. And using animal brains in the processed feed for livestock led to BSE in cattle and to CJD in humans who ate beef from infected cows.\nCONCLUSION: Vegetarians are vulnerable to food poisoning.\nVALIDITY:",

In public places, there is publicity. And in private places, there is privacy. People should not be worried about what other people see. People will see them no matter if they are there at the place itself or watching through a camera. Also cameras in public places are not made for those who are nosy and wish to spy on others. The police do their duty to protect the public, not to giggle and gawk at what they are doing.\nCONCLUSION: Video surveillance does not invade privacy in public places.\nVALIDITY:",

Six times as many homicides are committed by people under the influence of drugs, as by those who are looking for money to buy drugs. Most drug crimes aren\u2019t committed by people trying to pay for drugs; they\u2019re committed by people on drugs.\u2014 US Drug Enforcement Administration (2003). \"Speaking Out Against Drug Legalization\" DUF research indicates that: Frequent use of hard drugs is one of the strongest indicators of a criminal career. Offenders who use drugs are among the most serious and active criminals, engaging in both property and violent crime. Early and persistent use of cocaine or heroin in the juvenile years is an indicator of serious, persistent criminal behavior in adulthood. Those arrested who are drug users are more likely than those not using drugs to be rearrested on pretrial release or fail to appear at trial.\nCONCLUSION: Drug use leads to homicides, not drug use\nNOVELTY:",

The huge profits to be made from cocaine and other South American-grown drugs are largely because they are illegal in the wealthy neighbouring nation. This drives people in the relatively poor countries of Colombia, Peru, Bolivia and Brazil to break their own laws in organising the cultivation, preparation and trafficking of cocaine to the States. This has allowed criminal, paramilitary and guerrilla groups to reap huge profits, exacerbating already serious law-and-order and political problems.\nCONCLUSION: \"War on Drugs\" has contributed to instability in South America\nVALIDITY:",
