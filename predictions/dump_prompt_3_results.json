Six times as many homicides are committed by people under the influence of drugs, as by those who are looking for money to buy drugs. Most drug crimes aren\u2019t committed by people trying to pay for drugs; they\u2019re committed by people on drugs.\u2014 US Drug Enforcement Administration (2003). \"Speaking Out Against Drug Legalization\" DUF research indicates that: Frequent use of hard drugs is one of the strongest indicators of a criminal career. Offenders who use drugs are among the most serious and active criminals, engaging in both property and violent crime. Early and persistent use of cocaine or heroin in the juvenile years is an indicator of serious, persistent criminal behavior in adulthood. Those arrested who are drug users are more likely than those not using drugs to be rearrested on pretrial release or fail to appear at trial.\nCONCLUSION: Drug use and crime are not directly linked to criminal acts", "text": " being committed in order to get money to buy drugs.\nVALIDITY:not-valid, NOVELTY:not-novel", "tokens": [" being", " committed", " in", " order", " to", " get", " money", " to", " buy", " drugs", ".", "\n", "VAL", "ID", "ITY", ":", "not", "-", "valid", ",", " NO", "VEL", "TY", ":", "not", "-", "no", "vel", "<|endoftext|>", "\n", "\n", "The"], "logprob": [-1.0680237, -0.07818954, -0.074091725, -0.014453681, -0.00047207458, -0.8943517, -0.06468771, -0.2068451, -0.026378678, -0.00021908467, -0.41300946, -0.20395215, -0.026971495, -8.8051806e-05, -5.3363005e-05, -0.00011320953, -0.74508953, -0.0013344383, -2.4866502e-05, -0.005467833, -0.0029044796, -1.4974988e-05, -7.100402e-05, -8.0899285e-05, -0.44003204, -0.00019583241, -0.00034369153, -2.5744682e-06, -0.00031894777, -1.649464, -0.9214227, -3.0284305]}, "pred_nov": "not-novel", "pred_val": "not-valid"}, {"y_nov": "not-novel", "y_val": "valid", "x_nov": "TOPIC: Torture\nPREMISE: A terrorist will experience pain for a short period while being tortured.
