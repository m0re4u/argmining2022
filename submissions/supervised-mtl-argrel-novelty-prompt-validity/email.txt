Approach title: Supervised Multi-Task Learning using pretrained Transformers
Abstract: 
In this second mixed approach, we again combine two models for predictions of the tasks separately: we use OpenAI's GPT-3 for the classification of validity labels, which is trained in the same way as the model in our GPT-3 few-shot prompt engineering approach, and a supervised MTL model that was originally trained on an argument relationship task. Like before, we choose these two methods as we observed them to achieve high results on their respective task.

Extra training data: No extra data was used


predictions are attached.

Kind regards,
