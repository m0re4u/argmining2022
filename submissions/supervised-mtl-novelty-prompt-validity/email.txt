Approach title: Mixed GPT-3 and Multi-Task Learning
Abstract: 
For our mixed approach, we combine two models for predictions of the tasks separately: we use OpenAI's GPT-3 for the classification of validity labels, which is trained in the same way as the model in our GPT-3 few-shot prompt engineering approach, and roberta-large-mnli in a contrastive setting for the classification of the novelty labels. We choose these two methods as we observed them to achieve high results on their respective task.
        
Extra training data: None


predictions are attached.
